# CS250-FinalProject
Sprint Review and Retrospective

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
     The first step in interpreting user needs is to collect precise requirements, which are frequently represented through user stories. 
     I can create a program that directly meets the needs of the user by knowing what features and functionality they anticipate. By dividing complex requirements into smaller, more manageable tasks, user stories help           ensure that every aspect of the codebase is in line with the objectives of the user.
     From a user perspective, user stories help define the scope of work. Development relies on clarifying the user's goals and why they are important. Writing user stories for this project helped us focus on delivering     added  value at each stage and prioritize the most important things.

3. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    I follow a development methodology that breaks difficult problems down into manageable, testable chunks. Agile facilitates this by encouraging regular testing, continuous feedback, and iterative development. To ensure      continuous development and team alignment, I like to incorporate regular sprint planning, daily meetings, reviews, and backlog reviews into my future work.

4. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    Experienced team performers help others achieve team goals and communicate effectively. This entails being receptive to feedback and conversations, and helping overcome obstacles. In team development, I've discovered        that flexibility, empathy, and accountability are just as important as technical proficiency.
